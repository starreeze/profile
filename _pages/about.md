I am now a Master student working with Prof. [Xinyu Dai](https://ai.nju.edu.cn/daixinyu/) at [School of Artificial Intelligence](https://ai.nju.edu.cn), [Nanjing University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing_University). I got my B. Sci degree in Computer Science, [School of Computer Science and Technology](https://cs.nju.edu.cn), Nanjing University in 2023.

My research centers on the domain of **multimodality**, with a particular emphasis on the alignment and fusion of diverse modalities within Large Language Models (LLMs). Specifically, my recent work focuses on the **pretraining and preference alignment of Vision-Language models**, aiming to enhance their performance, factual accuracy, and trustworthiness. By exploring innovative strategies for integrating visual and textual information, I seek to advance the fieldâ€™s understanding of how multimodal systems can achieve more robust and reliable outcomes in real-world applications.
