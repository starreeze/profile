I am now a Master student (3 year, course and research based) working with Prof. [Xinyu Dai](https://ai.nju.edu.cn/daixinyu/) at [Natural Language Processing Group](https://nlp.nju.edu.cn), [School of Artificial Intelligence](https://ai.nju.edu.cn), [Nanjing University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing_University). I got my B.Sc. degree in Computer Science, [School of Computer Science and Technology](https://cs.nju.edu.cn), Nanjing University in 2023.

My research centers on the domain of **multimodality**, with a particular emphasis on the alignment and fusion of diverse modalities within Large Language Models (LLMs). Specifically, my recent work focuses on the **pretraining and preference alignment of Vision-Language models**, aiming to enhance their performance, factual accuracy, and trustworthiness. By exploring innovative strategies for integrating visual and textual information, I seek to advance the fieldâ€™s understanding of how multimodal systems can achieve more robust and reliable outcomes in real-world applications.

<span style="color: #b509ac;"><b>I am now actively seeking 2026 PhD opportunities and 2025 summer interns.</b></span> Here is my [cv](/profile/cv), or a pdf version [here](/profile/assets/pdf/CV.pdf). Full publication list is available [here](/profile/publications) or on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=u5pqxu0AAAAJ). Looking forward to your interest and recommendation!
