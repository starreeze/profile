I am now a Master student (3 year, course and research based) working with Prof. [Xinyu Dai](https://ai.nju.edu.cn/daixinyu/) at [Natural Language Processing Group](https://nlp.nju.edu.cn), [School of Artificial Intelligence](https://ai.nju.edu.cn), [Nanjing University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing_University). I got my B.Sc. degree in Computer Science, [School of Computer Science and Technology](https://cs.nju.edu.cn), Nanjing University in 2023.

My current research centers on the domain of **multimodality and RL for LLMs**, with the goal of advancing the capabilities and reliability of intelligent systems in complex, real-world scenarios.

1. **Pretraining and preference alignment of Vision-Language models.** This line of work investigates novel strategies for integrating visual and textual modalities during both pretraining and alignment stages. By improving VLMs' perceptual abilities, cross-modal understanding, and factual consistency, I aim to enhance their robustness and generalization across diverse applications.

2. **Reinforcement learning for reasoning Large Language Models.** Leveraging advanced RL techniques such as GRPO, along with new paradigms like concept-based and latent language modeling, this research seeks to enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities, enabling them to perform more sophisticated, coherent, and reliable reasoning in tasks that require structured thought, logical inference, and long-term planning.
